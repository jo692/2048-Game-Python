# 2048-Game-Python
A simple console based implementation of the 2048 game.

The player is given a 4x4 grid with one or two values (either 2 or 4) randomly placed at the start. The aim is to shift the numbers so that they merge to form the next power of 2. For example, merging two adjacent 2's will give a 4, likewise two 64's will merge to make 128. The end goal of the game is to make the number 2048 before the grid is full and thus can no longer be shifted.

This project was completed during a uni python module.
